tools to aid in vasp data analysis

ResultsAnalysis.py - Takes output files from vasp as input and returns data of interest

fix_layers.py - Takes an atom-like file (readable with ASE) and fixes a number of desired layers for selective dynamics

It may look clunky because it has remanents from an abandoned work.
I will modify it when new functionality is needed.
